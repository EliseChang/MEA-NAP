# AnalysisPipeline


## Getting started

Open `MEApipeline.m` in matlab, read through the instructions in section 1
and modify the parameters (full documentation upcoming).


## Troubleshooting

For most issues, please use the Issues tab on github and open a new issue,
eg. see an example issue [here](https://github.com/SAND-Lab/AnalysisPipeline/issues/1).
In other cases (if it is urgent / require long discussion with multiple lab members), you can also send a message on Slack / email.
