Setting up MATLAB
=================

This page is for **users who do not already have MATLAB or the required toolboxes installed**. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up MATLAB and downloading toolboxes required for our pipeline as add-ons. 

1. **Create a Free Mathworks Account**:

   - You will need a free Mathworks account to conveniently install MATLAB toolboxes that MEA-NAP requires.

   - If you do not currently have a Mathworks account, go to the [MathWorks website](https://www.mathworks.com/) and create one.


2. **Download MATLAB**:
   
   - For people using institutional licenses:
      - Please follow the instructions that your institution has provided for MATLAB installation

   - For individual users:
      - Log in to your MathWorks account and download the MATLAB version installer suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
      - Follow the installation instructions on website to complete the setup.

3. **Launch MATLAB**:

   - Once MATLAB is installed, launch the application.

   - If you are launching MATLAB for the first time, you will encounter the following 
      - Activation and License Agreement: MATLAB will prompt you to activate your license or provide a license file if you have not already done so. You'll need a valid license to use MATLAB. You will also need to accept the MathWorks License Agreement.

4. **Access the Add-Ons Menu**:

   - Click on the **Home** tab in MATLAB to access the main menu.
   - Locate and click on the **Add-Ons** dropdown menu.

      :alt: Add-ons dropdown menu

   - In the **Add-Ons** menu, you will find options to browse, install, and manage add-ons.
   - Click **Get Add-Ons** to access the MATLAB Add-On Explorer.

6. **Search for and Install Toolboxes**:

   - In the Add-On Explorer, you can search for specific toolboxes by entering keywords or browse the available categories.

   - Search for and install the following toolboxes:

     - Signal Processing Toolbox
     - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
     - Parallel Computing Toolbox
     - Curve Fitting Toolbox (for the calcium imaging pipeline)

   - You will also need the Brain Connectivity Toolbox, which cannot be installed through the Add-On Explorer:

     - This toolbox is found in the **MEA-NAP folder that you will download during step 8 of 'Setting Up MATLAB'**

7. **Access Installed Toolboxes**:

   - Once the installation is complete, you can access the newly installed toolbox functions in your MATLAB environment.

8. **Install Git (if not already installed)**:

   - Downloading MEA-NAP from GitHub will require Git. 

   - If you do not have Git installed, you can download and install it from the official website (https://git-scm.com/downloads). Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system (macOS, Windows, or Linux/Unix).

9. **Download MEA-NAP**:

   - Go to the home page of the MEA-NAP GitHub repository. To download the repository, you will need the repository's URL. Click the green "<> Code" button to open the dropdown menu. In this dropdown menu, copy the URL found in the HTTPS tab.

   - Open Terminal on your operating system.

   - Use the following commands in your terminal to download the MEA-NAP folder to your local device:

     .. code-block:: bash

         cd [local_directory]
         git clone [repository_url]

     - ``local_directory``: local directory where the MEA-NAP folder will be placed.
     - ``repository_url``: Specify the URL of the MEA-NAP GitHub repository you want to clone.

10. **Locate and Open MEA-NAP folder**:

    - Locate and open the MEA-NAP folder that you downloaded to your local device during the previous step.

11. **Locate and Open MEApipeline.m**:

    - Locate MEApipeline.m in your MEA-NAP folder.

    - Open MEApipeline.m in the MATLAB application that you installed in step 1.



Congratulations! You have successfully set up MATLAB and downloaded required toolboxes toextend MATLAB's functionality.
