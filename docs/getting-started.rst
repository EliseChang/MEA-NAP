Getting Started with the MEA-NAP
======================================

Our MEA pipeline is designed to be accessible to users with varying levels of MATLAB experience. Whether you are a beginner or an advanced user, this guide will help you get started.

For Beginners
-------------------------------

If you have limited or no experience with MATLAB, we recommend using our interactive GUI mode. This mode simplifies the process of selecting directory paths and adjusting parameters for the pipeline. To use the GUI mode, follow the steps found at this link:

For Advanced Users
------------------

Advanced users with extensive MATLAB experience can directly modify parameters in the MEA pipeline MATLAB script. To do so, follow the steps found at this link: 

Familiarizing Yourself with the Pipeline
----------------------------------------

To become familiar with the MEA pipeline and its capabilities, we recommend the following steps:

1. **Run a Pair of Files:** Start by running a pair of sample data files through all the steps of the pipeline. This will give you a quick overview of the process.

2. **Select a Larger Subset:** Next, choose a larger subset of your dataset and run it through the pipeline. This will help you gauge the performance of the pipeline with a more substantial workload.

3. **Run Your Entire Dataset:** Once you are confident in the pipeline's performance, proceed to run your entire dataset. Be prepared to monitor the process and review the results.

By following these steps, you can effectively familiarize yourself with the MEA pipeline and use it to process your data with confidence.

We are here to support you throughout your journey with the pipeline. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to our documentation or submit GitHub issues.
