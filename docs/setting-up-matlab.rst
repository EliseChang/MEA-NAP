Setting up MATLAB
=================

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up MATLAB and downloading toolboxes required for our pipeline as add-ons. 

1. **Download MATLAB**:
   
   - For people using instutional licenses
      - Please follow the instructions that your institution has provided for MATLAB installation

   - For individual users:
      - Visit the MathWorks website (https://www.mathworks.com/) and create a MathWorks account if you don't have one.
      - Log in to your MathWorks account and download the MATLAB version installer suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
      - Follow the installation instructions on website to complete the setup.

2. **Launch MATLAB**:

   - Once MATLAB is installed, launch the application.

   - If you are launching MATLAB for the first time, you will encounter the following 
      - Activation and License Agreement: MATLAB will prompt you to activate your license or provide a license file if you have not already done so. You'll need a valid license to use MATLAB. You will also need to accept the MathWorks License Agreement.
