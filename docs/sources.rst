Code sources
==============

The network analysis pipeline is both built on code and packages written by other users in the spike detection and network analysis community, and by our authors. In the methods section we cited packages used for corresponding analysis, but here we want to make sure to reinforce the help provided by the work we built upon:


Spike detection:

 - `Spike detection with the continuous wavelet transform <http://cbmspc.eng.uci.edu/SOFTWARE/SPIKEDETECTION/spikedetection.html>`_

Network Analysis:

 - `Spike Time Tiling Coefficient <https://github.com/CCutts/Detecting_pairwise_correlations_in_spike_trains/blob/master/spike_time_tiling_coefficient.c>`_
 - `Brain Connectivity Toolbox <https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/>`_
 - Coded based on description in `Node cartograpy <https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03288?report=reader>`_
 - Coded based on description in `Effective rank <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7098875/>`_
